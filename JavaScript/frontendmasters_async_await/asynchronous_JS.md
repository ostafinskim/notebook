# JavaScript - The new hard parts

As soon as we start running our code we create a global execution context.

- Thread of execution ( parsin and executing the code line by line ).
- Live memory of variables with data ( known as Global Variable Environment ).

When we want to execute code inside a function we create local execution context, with local variables environment.
